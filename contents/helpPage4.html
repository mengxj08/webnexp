      <p><strong>What is a condition?</strong></p> 
      <p>A particular independent variable “Technique” has two levels: XXX-Pod and iPod. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If it is the only independent variable considered, this experiment has two conditions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, an experiment rarely only has 1 independent variable, suppose there is another independent variable “Menu Breadth” with 3 levels (4, 8, 12). </p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are 2 (Techniques) x 3 (Menu Breadth) = 6 experimental conditions</li>
        <li>The each unique combination of the different levels of the various independent variables (such as XXX-Pod, 4) is an experimental condition </li>
      </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="jumbotron">
        <p><strong>How can We Test These Conditions?</strong></p>
        <p>Method I: Between-Subject Design</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recruit 6 participants, one for each condition (this is also called between-subject design, which means the conditions are tested between different subjects):</li>
          <li>P1: earPod, 4</li>
          <li>P2: earPod, 8</li>
          <li>P3: earPod, 12</li>
          <li>P4: iPod, 4</li>
          <li>P5: iPod, 8</li>
          <li>P6: iPod 12 </li>
        </ul>
        <p>What’s the problem of this Method I? </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What about individual differences? </li>
          <li>To balance individual differences, we need lots of participants</li>
          <li><strong>Key insight: </strong>this method is expensive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Method II: Within-Subject Design</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recruit the same participants to test all 6 conditions (this is also called within-subject design since all conditions are tested within the same subject):</li>
          <li>P1: earPod, 4</li>
          <li>P1: earPod, 8</li>
          <li>P1: earPod, 12</li>
          <li>P1: iPod, 4</li>
          <li>P1: iPod, 8</li>
          <li>P1: iPod 12 </li>
        </ul>
        <p>What’s the problem of this Method II? </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Practice (or order effect) as a confounding variable </li>
          <li>However, in many cases, this effect can be controlled </li>
          <li><strong>Key insight: </strong>this method is much more economica.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="jumbotron">
      <p>Under within-subject design, we need to control order/learning effect using counter-balancing strategies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fully CounterBalancing: full permutation of all the conditions</li>
          <li>Latin Square: Ensures each level appears in every position in order equally often</li>
          <li>No CounterBalancing: No learning effect</li>
